                <h5 className="body-text">Since the inception of South Asian-Western fusion A Capella with Penn Masala at the University of Penn Masala, South Asian A Capella groups have become a university trend to stay. At Brown, I am a part of a South Asian fusion A Capella group - Barsaat. Growing up in Mumbai, I was surrounded by people from my culture and ethnicity. Moving to Brown was a welcome change, yet I missed a piece of home. In a foreign place, Barsaat provided a home away from home with like-minded people who shared my love for music. It has been a massive part of my college experience, and as the years have gone by, we have only become bigger and better.

                Recently, we hit a milestone and started performing at places outside Brown - local restaurants and Wellesley college, to name a few. Post our performances, we were often told how hard it was to find information about our group. Our hosts could only see us through Instagram. As a group gaining popularity, we figured it was high time we created our own website where users can gain information about our group more efficiently!</h5>

                <h5 className="body-text">How can I create a seamless process for users to gain information and contact Barsaat's executive board about the group's previous performances, upcoming events, and other news for better insight before hiring our group?</h5>

I noticed that most websites adopted a darker color palette. Almost all of them had a page highlighting current and past members. I also found it interesting that all websites highlighted the group's previous performances in addition to their repertoire. However, only The Brown Derbies highlighted the group's audition process. As Barsaat is similar to the Derbies in a non-competitive, performance-focused way, I wanted to include an audition process section during the iterations.</h5>

                <h3 className="section-sub-sub-header">Iteration 1</h3>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚úÖ</span> Goal 1: Inform potential Barsaatees</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚ùå</span> Goal 2: Call-to-Action for Non-Brown University Organizations</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚ùå</span> Goal 3: Create a more permanent online presence</h5>
                
                <div className="gif-container">
                    <img src={Iteration1_1} className="gif"></img>
                    <img src={Iteration1_2} className="gif"></img>
                    <img src={Iteration1_3} className="gif"></img>
                </div>

                <h5 className="body-text">During this stage, I hit a block. I could not fill the empty space on each page (Upcoming, Performances, Members etc.). As a result, I ended up focusing only on the UI elements instead of the UX. I realized this drew user attention away from the content to only visual design, which defeated the website's purpose. I wanted to completely change up the designs but decided to user-test them before to gain more insight into the direction in which the changes should be. Here's a summary of the feedback:</h5>

                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">üë®‚Äçüéì</span> Members & Alumni pages did not need to be separated and could be under the same bucket.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚¨õ</span> Black as a background is too overwhelming.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">üìÉ</span> The purpose of the Landing page and About page is too similar</h5>

                <h3 className="section-sub-sub-header">Iteration 2</h3>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚ùå</span> Goal 1: Inform potential Barsaatees</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚úÖ</span> Goal 2: Call-to-Action for Non-Brown University Organizations</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚úÖ</span> Goal 3: Create a more permanent online presence</h5>

                </div>

                <h5 className="body-text">I incorporated user feedback and instinct in the second iteration to completely change the designs. Instead of a darker color palette, I chose a semi-pastel one complementing Barsaat's logo. Instead of a separate-page layout, I transferred most of the information onto the landing page - only separating the "For Fun!" page. I felt much more confident with the second iteration and tested them on the same people as the first one. Here's a summary of the findings..</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">üéØ</span> There should be more than one way to access information about auditions instead of only through the About section.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">ü§î</span> Users thought the Contact section could have more information connecting it to the rest of the prototype. Information like "when would users get in touch", etc.</h5>

                <h3 className="section-sub-sub-header">Iteration 3</h3>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚úÖ</span> Goal 1: Visual, descriptive & easy-to-use Amenities section</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text"><span role="img" aria-label="hi">‚úÖ</span> Goal 2: Community page highlighting BeauMonde‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äù factor</h5>

                <h5 className="body-text">In the third iteration, I wanted to focus on the Auditions section for prospective Barsaatees. It is essential to display a timeline as Barsaat auditions occur twice an academic year. I also wanted to highlight the audition process to provide complete transparency. But, I wanted to do so in a relaxed manner to avoid creating a "serious/intimidating" vibe.</h5>
