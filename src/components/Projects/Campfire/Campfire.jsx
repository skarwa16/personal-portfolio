                <h2 className="section-header">Overview</h2>
                <h5 className="body-text">Dubbed as the software that facilitates ‚ÄúActually fun remote team socials‚Äù, Campfire (accessible at Campfire.to) is levelling up the fun and interaction you‚Äôre able to have when bonding with team members in a distributed work environment. As a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) business, Campfire caters to companies looking to have innovative team socials that go beyond all-too-frequently-used Zoom breakout rooms. On Campfire, games, TV, music and multi-person video calling are embedded onto one platform, creating an interactive and immersive experience. Campfire was founded in 2021 by Siamak Freydoonnejad and Sina Zargaran, and has been supported by YCombinator as part of their Winter 2022 Batch.

                For our project, we had to choose a startup with a clear concept and design their web or mobile application from scratch without viewing any interfaces they built.</h5>

                <h5 className="body-text">Idea #2 has a traditional webpage header bar with dropdown menu items that is consistent through each of its pages. Contrast this with the other ideas, which do not have a header bar and thus makes the experience more immersive.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">Ideas #1, #2 and #3 try to incorporate the idea of a campfire into the platform: Idea #1 places people‚Äôs video call windows around a campfire backdrop to mimic a gathering around a real campfire; Idea #2 has a stand-alone campfire graphic, creating a separation between the idea of a campfire and the website itself; and Idea #3 uses a campfire as a button to call friends. Contrast this with Idea #4, which focuses on the more mechanical components of selecting and engaging in an activity.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">Idea #2 is the only one that incorporates testimonials as part of a way to draw customers in (remember that Campfire is a SaaS company). This is distinctly different from the other ideas which are more inwards-facing (towards existing rather than prospective customers).</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">Idea #3 distinctly suggests a chat feature to complement video calling, which the other Ideas do not suggest.</h5>

                <h3 className="section-sub-header">Analysis</h3>
                <h3 className="section-sub-sub-header">Our Expectations</h3>
                
                <h5 className="body-text">We designed our interface to be as simple and intuitive as possible, and expected users to find it easy to use. We also used the startup‚Äôs name as a unifying them in our design choices when designing the protoype, and even tried to link the language we used to the unifying theme. To that end, we used the company‚Äôs logo as the home button. We expected users to connect the logo with returning to some sort of home page, since this tends to be a convention among web interfaces.</h5>

                <h3 className="section-sub-sub-header">User Feedback</h3>

                <h5 className="body-text">We received overwhelmingly positive feedback about our branding, design, and colour scheme, though some users noted that the design might be better suited for younger users.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">All users reported that the interface was easy to use, with all of them giving a rating of ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or very easy‚Äù after each task.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">Surprisingly, most users didn‚Äôt find the logo to be an intuitive ‚Äúhome button‚Äù. One user said this was because it didn‚Äôt immediately draw their eye, and that having some accompanying text would be helpful.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">Some users also noted that having pop-ups or instructions of some sort would be helpful for first-time users, though others noted that the interface was quite intuitive and accessible even to people with limited technological experience.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">A user also noted that being able to resize the video gallery would be helpful.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">All users reported being very likely (8 or above) to recommend the website to a friend, with one user reporting a 10 on this scale.</h5>

                <h3 className="section-sub-sub-header">Final Observations</h3>
                <h5 className="body-text">Users in general completed the tasks quickly, stopping only to talk or provide feedback on the interface.</h5>
                <h5 className="body-text">We did have to disregard some tests because of the users not reading the tests‚Äô instructions correctly and completing the wrong task. However, given that the majority of users were able to complete all tasks correctly, we believe this is due to the individual user‚Äôs disposition and not because of a flaw in the interface or test instructions.</h5>
